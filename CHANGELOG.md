## [Upcoming]

### Changed

- Improved code quality and maintainability by using `enum_dispatch` for weather providers.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- Add `--one-line` option to display weather information in a single line.
- Add `--text-mode` option to CLI and `text_mode` option to config file to choose between `full` (default), `compact`
  and `one_line` modes.
- Implement automatic config file migration for `compact_mode` to `text_mode`.

### Changed

- Temperature now shows only one decimal place for better readability.

### Removed

- :boom: Config file option `compact_mode` removed due to introduction of multiple text modes. Use
  `text_mode = "compact"`
  instead. `--compact` CLI option is still supported though.

## [0.1.5] - 2025-08-27

### Added

- Compact mode (`--compact` in cli or `compact_mode = true` in config) to use only 5 lines of output and less width
  without labels.
- Option to show wind direction in degrees instead of arrows (`--degrees` in cli or `use_degrees_for_wind = true` in
  config).
- Unit tests for verifying correct formatting in different modes and configurations.

### Changed

- The following CLI options have been renamed. Old names are still supported for backward compatibility:
    - `--show-city-name` to `--name`
    - `--use-colors` to `--colors`
    - `--live-mode` to `--live`
    - `--live-mode-interval` to `--interval`
    - `--output-format` to `--format`
    - `--language` to `--lang`
